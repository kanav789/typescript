<!-- Javascript -->

# Javascript (also known as ecmaScript) started its life as a simple scripting language for browser.

# At the time ,when javascript is invented, it was expected to used for short snippets of embedded in web page.

# Over time, though, JS became more and more popular, and web developers started using it to create interactive experiences.

<!-- TypeScript -->

# TypeScript is a programming language which is build on javascript.

# TypeScript checks error in program before execution ,at the time of implementation.

# TypeScript preserve the runtime behaviour of javascript.For Example , dividng by zero in javascript produces "Infinity" instead of throwing a runtime exception.

# So ,Basically its check the type of the variable, if the value of variable is given then its okey but if the value is not given. so at that time compiler confused to find the type of declare variable.
